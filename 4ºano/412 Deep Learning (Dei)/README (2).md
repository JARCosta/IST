# Welcome to the Deep Learning Course (2021-2022) Praticals Instructions for Running Notebooks

## Installation of virtual environment for Pratical Sessions
#### 1. To set the virtual environment to run these pratical sessions we suggest the use conda. If you do not have you can install one of these two options:
  - [Anaconda (management system with some packages already built in)](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
  - [Miniconda (management system without packages)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

#### 2. Download the environment.yml file and use it to create the virtual environment: 
  - download the environment.yml to a directory of your choice
  - \[Windows\] open command line and change the current working directory to the one containing the environment file (example below for the case where the file was downloaded to the Downloads directory - replace <current_user> by your user name):
  ```
    cd C:\Users\<current_user>\Downloads\
  ```
  - \[Mac/Linux\] open command line and change the current working directory to the one containing the environment file (example below for the case where the file was downloaded to the Downloads directory - replace <current_user> by your user name):
  ```
    cd ~/Downloads
  ```
  - create environment (called IST_DL21_Env) and install required packages automatically:
  ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

### Activate environment and start jupyter notebook:
  ```
    conda activate IST_DL21_Env
    jupyter notebook
  ```

## Use Google Colaboratory to run the Pratical Sessions (requires Google Account)

Use the following link https://colab.research.google.com/ to open Google Colaboratory (Colab)

One of the two following windows will be visible to you:

### You can also open a notebook saved in your Google Drive or upload an existing jupyter notebook by going to File -> Open notebook/Upload notebook which will bring you to the following two windows (the open to open Recent notebooks, notebooks present in your Google Drive, and notebooks available in Github repositories).

### Colab has CPU, GPU and TPU runtime types available for you to run your notebooks. While on the first praticals you may only need a CPU instance, from practical 5 you may take advantage of a GPU instance. To change runtime type you can do as follows.
